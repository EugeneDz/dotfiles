### Install
---
**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork or clone this repo then review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need.

In general, the installation is required **Xcode Command Line Tools**. Is a large suite of software development tools and libraries from Apple. The Xcode Command Line Tools are part of XCode. Installation of many common Unix-based tools requires the GCC compiler. The Xcode Command Line Tools include a GCC compiler.

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

When installation of the Xcode is completed run a setup script.

```bash
sh ~/dotfiles/boostrap.sh
```

Final steps is installation of **Node.js** and  **npm packages** which are usually used day-to-day basis.

```bash
$ nvm install node
```

```bash
sh ~/dotfiles/install/npm.sh
```
